# Lab 1- Algorithms & Basic Sequential Programs

*Develop an algorithm that prompts the user to enter two integer numbers, calculates the sum of the two numbers and then displays the following :
The two numbers entered
The sum of the two numbers.

Using JavaScript, develop a program for the above algorithm


Develop an algorithm that prompts the user to enter the relevant data that is required to calculate the area of a circle, your algorithm must then calculate the area, the circumference and then display the following :
The area of the circle 
The circumference of the circle

Using JavaScript, develop a program for the above algorithm

Develop an algorithm  that prompts the user for relevant data that is required to  calculate an hourly paid worker's gross salary and net salary. You are to assume that employees in this fictional scenario are paid per week and the only deduction that all employees incur is  a 25% tax on their gross salary.

Using JavaScript, develop a program for the above algorithm


Develop an algorithm that prompts the user to enter  a price of an item, item number, item title and a discount percent from the user which should represent the percentage that would be discounted from the item. 
The algorithm should then display the following :
 Original price of the item
The discounted amount
The amount the customer must pay.


Using JavaScript, develop a program for the above algorithm

Develop an algorithm that prompts the user to enter  a person’s name and their weight in kilograms (kg).The algorithm should then convert the person’s weight in pounds and display the answer to the user. 
NOTE : 1 kilogram = 2.2 pounds.

Using JavaScript, develop a program for the above algorithm.

Develop a script using JavaScript, which, when run, works as follows:
Hi, what's your name ? Mr.Best
Welcome to our show, Mr Best
How old are you? 52
Hmmmm, you don’t look a day over 47
Tell me, Mr.Best , where do you live ? Toronto
Oh, I’ve heard Toronto is a lovely place
